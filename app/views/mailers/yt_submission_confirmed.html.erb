Thank you for your recent submission to Lumen Database with subject "<%= @notice.subject %>".

You can link to the notice using the following URL: https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/<%= @notice.id %>

At the moment, that is likely a placeholder page, but if the notice is annotated and published, the link will resolve to the published notice.

If you have any questions, please contact our team, team@lumendatabase.org.
